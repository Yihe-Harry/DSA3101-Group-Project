  <em>Machine Learning for Personalized Marketing Campaigns in Banking</em> <br>
</p>

# Project Overview
Traditional bank marketing strategies often rely on mass campaigns and generic customer segmentation. This can often lead to low engagement rates, inefficient resource allocation as well as reduced customer satisfaction due to poorly targeted offers. Irrelevant financial offers lead to low customer engagement, resulting in missed opportunities for both banks and consumers.

With advancements in AI and machine learning, there is an opportunity to transform bank marketing by personalising customer interactions based on customer behaviour, transaction history and real-time behavioural insights. By leveraging AI to analyse customer data, predict preferences and deliver highly relevant marketing campaigns, we hope to be able to provide tailored financial product recommendations and offer loans, credit cards and investment plans at the right time, in order to improve customer experience, increase engagement and optimise marketing efficiency.

Our goal is to enhance customer satisfaction, improve conversion rates and maximise marketing ROI, all while ensuring compliance with the strict regulations that govern the banking industry.

# Limitations
Due to the the sensitive and confidential nature of financial data, we were not able to obtain large amounts of real and up to date data of customer details and activity. To overcome this, we generated synthetic data based on research-backed distributions in order to reflect realistic customer behaviors as best as we could. While we aimed to model real-world banking scenarios, certain assumptions had to be made regarding customer behaviors, spending patterns, and engagement metrics. There are a plethora of variables affecting customer behaviours and our simplified and generalised models due to our limited resources may not capture all the complexities involved. 

# Project Structure
This project is divided into two key components:

Customer Segmentation & Behaviour Analysis – Focuses on identifying customer groups and analysing their financial behaviours. (See GrpA_models)

Personalisation & Campaign Optimisation – Uses AI to tailor marketing campaigns and optimise outreach strategies. (See GrpB_models)
