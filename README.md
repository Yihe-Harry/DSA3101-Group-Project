<h2>Project Overview</h2>
Banks are facing challenges in optimising their marketing strategies, struggling to efficiently allocate resources and engage customers in a personalised way. Traditional methods fail to utilise the continuous influx of valuable customer data.<br>
This project aims to build an AI-driven system that leverages machine learning techniques to craft personalised marketing campaigns. By extracting data-driven insights, we aim to enhance customer engagement, improve conversion rates, and transform our marketing approach. Here are some key features of our system:<br>

- Customer segmentation: Clustering customers based on behavioural data

- Predictive modelling: Forecasting customer needs for targeted campaigns and identifying customers with high risk of churning

- API Development: API to serve model predictions

- Ease of deployment: Containerised application using Docker for easy deployment
