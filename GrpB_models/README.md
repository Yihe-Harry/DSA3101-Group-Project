## Overview
This directory focuses on the personalisation and optimisation of marketing campaigns to improve customer engagement, maximise Return on Investment (ROI) and enhance overall campaign effectiveness. The project is divided into key areas that target various aspects of personalising and optimising marketing campaigns.

## Directory Structure
The directory contains the following subdirectories, each representing a key area of focus for personalising or optimising marketing campaigns:

### Predicting Customer Preferences
This folder focuses on predicting individual customer needs and prefernces for marketing purposes. The objective is to develop a recommendation system using machine learning to suggest relevant products or services to customers. The expected outcome is to deliver a model that can accurately predict customer behaviour.

### Campaign Optimisation
Here, you will find tools and methodologies aimed at improving the targeting and effectiveness of marketing campaigns. This includes segmentation techniques and strategies for dynamically adapting content based on customer profiles.

### Measuring Campaign ROI
This directory focuses on measuring and maximising the ROI for personalised marketing campaigns. The objective is to develop a model that predicts the ROI of various campaigns by incorporating factors such as Cost Per Click. The expected outcome is to provide actionable recommendations on which campaign strategies yield the best ROI.

### Cost-Effectiveness of Campaigns
This section focuses on balancing personalisation with cost-effectiveness in marketing campaigns. It aims to design a cost-benefit analysis model that evaluates the impact of personalised marketing strategies. The objective is to create a framework that ensures an optimal balance between personalised marketing efforts and cost management, ultimately maximising returns while managing expenses efficiently.

### Customer Retention Strategies
This section explores strategies for enhancing customer retention, with a focus on using machine learning to predict and mitigate customer churn. The objective is to build a churn prediction model that identifies customers at risk of leaving. The expected outcome is the development of an early warning system that helps minimise customer churn.
