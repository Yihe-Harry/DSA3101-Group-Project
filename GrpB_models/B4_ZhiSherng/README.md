# 1)	Overview of the model's functionality and justification for the chosen approaches
## 1.1) Introduction
This report outlines a data-driven approach to balancing personalisation and cost-effectiveness in bank marketing campaigns. The proposed framework integrates customer segmentation, predictive modeling, and constrained optimisation to determine the most efficient marketing spend while maximising customer response rates and Return on Investment (ROI).

## 1.2) Methodology
### Step 1: Customer Segmentation

To better understand customer behaviour, an initial segmentation is performed using unsupervised learning techniques such as K-Means clustering, DBSCAN, or Autoencoders. This step helps group customers based on demographics, transaction patterns, engagement history, and economic conditions.

**Justification for the Chosen Approach**

The choice of clustering techniques such as K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering is driven by their simplicity and effectiveness, making the resulting customer segments easier to interpret. These methods provide clear, actionable insights that align with the need for transparency in financial decision-making. In contrast, deep learning-based clustering approaches, such as autoencoders, were avoided due to their opacity, which could create challenges in justifying decisions within the financial sector. More complex clustering methods like Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) are often difficult to interpret, which can hinder compliance teams from explaining and defending marketing strategies.

To address these interpretability concerns, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) is used to analyze the contributions of individual features to the segmentation process. This ensures that the model remains transparent and compliant with industry standards, allowing stakeholders to better understand the factors driving customer groupings.


### Step 2: Predicting Customer Response Probability
A machine learning model (e.g., logistic regression, XGBoost, or neural networks) is trained to predict the probability of each customer responding to a marketing campaign. The model leverages various features, including:

1. Customer attributes (age, income, credit score, financial behaviour, etc)
2. Past response history (engagement with previous campaigns, etc)
3. Economic indicators (inflation rates, interest rates, etc)
4. Transaction data (spending patterns, savings behavior, etc)

The model outputs a probability score between 0 and 1, indicating the likelihood of a customer responding to a given marketing effort.

**Justification for the Chosen Approach**

XGBoost and Random Forest were chosen for their strong predictive power and ability to provide valuable insights into feature importance, making them well-suited for predicting customer responses. These models offer a balance between high performance and interpretability, which is crucial for actionable insights. On the other hand, neural networks were deliberately excluded due to their "black-box" nature, which complicates understanding the reasons behind a customerâ€™s predicted response.

Given regulatory requirements such as GDPR and CCPA, explainability is a key concern, making opaque models like deep learning unsuitable. To ensure transparency, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) and LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) are employed. These techniques offer detailed, interpretable insights into the factors influencing customer response predictions, thus ensuring compliance and enhancing model trustworthiness.


### Step 3: Determining Optimal Personalisation Level & Cost Estimation
Instead of predicting personalisation levels and cost separately, a cost-aware personalisation model is employed. This model determines the optimal level of personalisation (e.g., generic email, targeted SMS, personalised call) while estimating the cost associated with each option.

Inputs: Customer profile, predicted response probability, campaign type
Outputs:
Personalisation level (e.g., mass email vs. tailored offer)
Estimated cost per personalisation level
Machine learning techniques such as reinforcement learning (RL) or Bayesian optimization can be used to dynamically adjust personalisation levels based on expected response.

### Step 4: Predicting ROI Metrics
To evaluate cost-effectiveness, additional models predict key business metrics, including:

Expected revenue per customer
Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)
Cost per successful response
These predictions help quantify the financial impact of marketing efforts before optimization.

### Step 5: Constrained Budget Optimisation
A constrained optimisation algorithm is applied to maximize response rates and ROI while ensuring that marketing costs remain within the allocated budget.

Objective Function: Maximise campaign effectiveness (response rate, revenue uplift)
Constraints:
Budget limitations (total marketing spend)
Customer fatigue limits (avoid excessive contact)
Regulatory constraints (compliance with data privacy laws)
Optimisation techniques such as Linear Programming (LP), Quadratic Programming (QP), or Reinforcement Learning can be used to allocate the budget across different customer segments efficiently.

## 1.3) Expected Outcome
By integrating predictive analytics with cost-aware optimisation, the proposed approach ensures that:

1. Personalisation is tailored to customer needs while staying cost-effective
2. Marketing spend is optimised to maximise engagement and ROI
3. Business constraints (budget, regulations, customer fatigue) are respected in campaign execution.
4. This model provides a scalable, data-driven solution for banks looking to enhance marketing efficiency while maintaining high response rates.
