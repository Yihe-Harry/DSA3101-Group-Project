# 1) Introduction
This report outlines a data-driven approach to balancing personalisation and cost-effectiveness in bank marketing campaigns. The proposed framework integrates customer segmentation, predictive modeling, and constrained optimisation to determine the most efficient marketing spend while maximising customer response rates and Return on Investment (ROI). Additionally, the framework takes into account key concerns in the banking industry, including regulatory compliance, transparency, and the need for interpretable models to ensure responsible and ethical marketing practices.

# 2) Methodology and justification
## 2.1) Approach
### Step 1: Customer Segmentation 

To better understand customer behaviour, segmentation is performed using unsupervised learning techniques such as K-Means clustering and Hierarchical Clustering. This groups customers based on demographics, transaction patterns, engagement history, and economic conditions, allowing for more precise targeting. By identifying distinct customer clusters, we can define clear marketing objectives for each group, ensuring campaigns focus on relevant goals, such as retention for high-value customers or conversion for low-engagement segments.

Segmentation also enables the use of more relevant ROI metrics when evaluating marketing effectiveness. Instead of applying generic KPIs, we can track Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) for high-value segments and Cost Per Successful Response (CPSR) for acquisition-focused groups. This approach improves response rate predictions, refines budget allocation, and ensures that marketing investments are efficiently distributed to maximise impact. By aligning marketing efforts with customer behaviour, segmentation enhances cost-effectiveness and overall campaign success.

**Justification for the Chosen Approach**

The choice of clustering techniques such as K-Means clustering and Hierarchical Clustering is driven by their simplicity and effectiveness, making the resulting customer segments easier to interpret. These methods provide clear, actionable insights that align with the need for transparency in financial decision-making. In contrast, more complex clustering methods like Gaussian Mixture Models, were avoided due to their opacity, which could create challenges in justifying decisions within the financial sector.

To aid these interpretability concerns, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) will be deployed when necessary to understand the contributions of individual features to the segmentation process. This ensures that the model remains transparent and compliant with industry standards, allowing stakeholders to better understand the factors driving customer groupings.

Additionally, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) will be employed to mitigate the impact of high-dimensional feature spaces on the segmentation process. By transforming correlated variables into a smaller set of uncorrelated principal components, PCA helps reduce redundancy while preserving the most significant variance in the data. This not only improves computational efficiency but also ensures that clustering methods like K-Means or Hierarchical Clustering operate on a more manageable and interpretable feature space.

Furthermore, reducing dimensionality with PCA can help address potential overfitting issues, especially when working with highly granular financial and behavioural data. By retaining only the most informative components, PCA enables a more robust and generalisable segmentation while maintaining transparency, a key requirement in the banking sector. This approach ensures that marketing strategies remain data-driven and aligned with compliance standards while still being efficient and actionable.


### Step 2: Predicting Customer Response Probability
To predict the likelihood of a customer responding to a marketing campaign, a machine learning model, such as Random Forest or XGBoost, is trained using historical customer data. The objective is to generate a response probability score between 0 and 1, where values closer to 1 indicate a higher likelihood of engagement. The model utilises a diverse set of features to make accurate predictions:

1. Customer Attributes – Demographic and financial characteristics, such as age, income, credit score, and financial behaviour, help identify trends in customer responsiveness.
2. Past Response History – Analysing previous engagement with marketing campaigns enables the model to recognise patterns in how customers react to different outreach efforts.
3. Economic Indicators – External factors like inflation rates, interest rates, and economic stability can influence a customer’s financial behaviour and willingness to engage.
4. Transaction Data – Spending habits, savings patterns, and recent financial activities provide crucial signals about a customer's likelihood to respond to marketing efforts.


**Justification for the Chosen Approach**

XGBoost and Random Forest were chosen for their strong predictive power and ability to provide valuable insights into feature importance, making them well-suited for predicting customer responses. These models offer a balance between high performance and interpretability, which is crucial for actionable insights. On the other hand, neural networks were deliberately excluded due to their "black-box" nature, which complicates understanding of the reasons behind a customer’s predicted response.

Given the banking sector's need for transparency in decision-making, it is essential to understand which factors contribute to a customer's likelihood of responding to a marketing campaign. To aid this, techniques such as SHAP and Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) will be applied. These methods provide detailed insights into how different customer attributes—such as financial behaviour, transaction history, and engagement patterns influence response probabilities. By leveraging these explainability techniques, banks can ensure that marketing decisions are transparent, auditable, and aligned with ethical and regulatory expectations while also refining their strategies based on key drivers of customer engagement.


### Step 3: Determining Optimal Personalisation Level & Cost Estimation
Rather than predicting personalisation levels and costs separately, a cost-aware personalisation model is used to determine the optimal level of personalisation (e.g., generic email, targeted SMS, or personalised call) while estimating the cost associated with each option.

Inputs: Customer profile, predicted response probability, campaign type
Outputs: Personalisation level (e.g., mass email vs. tailored offer), estimated cost per personalisation level

Machine learning techniques such as reinforcement learning (RL) or Bayesian optimisation can be applied to dynamically adjust personalisation levels based on expected response rates.

**Justification for the Chosen Approach**

Bayesian Optimisation is chosen to identify the most cost-effective personalisation strategy for each customer while dynamically adjusting engagement levels based on response probability and cost constraints. Although Reinforcement Learning (RL) could theoretically optimise personalisation in a dynamic manner, its lack of interpretability makes it unsuitable for financial applications where transparency is essential. Financial regulations and business decision-making processes require clear explanations of model outputs, making black-box optimisation approaches difficult to justify. By contrast, Bayesian Optimisation offers a structured, probabilistic method that effectively balances cost and response probability while ensuring transparency in decision-making.


### Step 4: Predicting ROI Metrics
To evaluate cost-effectiveness, additional models are used to predict key business metrics such as expected revenue per customer, Customer Lifetime Value (CLV), and cost per successful response. These predictions help quantify the financial impact of marketing efforts before optimisation, ensuring that marketing strategies align with business objectives.

**Justification for the Chosen Approach**

To measure the financial effectiveness of marketing campaigns, XGBoost is used to predict key ROI metrics, including Expected Revenue Uplift, CLV, and Cost per Successful Response. This model offers a strong balance between predictive accuracy and interpretability, allowing financial teams to audit and justify marketing investments. Since ROI models play a crucial role in corporate decision-making, they must provide clear and defensible justifications for financial forecasts to align with corporate reporting standards.

A key concern is ensuring that stakeholders understand how different factors contribute to ROI predictions. To address this, SHAP values are used to explain how various customer attributes influence the predicted financial outcomes. This approach enhances transparency, making the model’s outputs more interpretable for decision-makers and ensuring compliance with financial accountability requirements.


### Step 5: Constrained Budget Optimisation
A constrained optimisation algorithm is applied to maximise response rates and ROI while ensuring that marketing costs remain within the allocated budget. The objective function aims to enhance campaign effectiveness by optimising response rates and revenue uplift while adhering to constraints such as budget limitations, customer fatigue limits (to prevent excessive contact), and regulatory compliance with data privacy laws. Optimisation techniques such as Linear Programming (LP), Quadratic Programming (QP), or Reinforcement Learning can be used to distribute the budget efficiently across different customer segments.

**Justification for the Chosen Approach**

To ensure efficient budget allocation while maintaining compliance with financial and regulatory constraints, a Linear Programming (LP) or Quadratic Programming (QP) approach is adopted. These methods provide a structured and deterministic optimisation process that balances maximum expected response rates with budget limits while preventing excessive marketing exposure for any particular customer segment.

Although Reinforcement Learning (RL) could theoretically enhance budget allocation by dynamically adjusting spending based on real-time feedback, its unpredictability and high complexity make it unsuitable for financial contexts where stability and transparency are critical. LP and QP, on the other hand, offer a controlled and deterministic approach, ensuring that marketing budgets are allocated optimally while maintaining predictability in financial planning. This structured methodology allows marketing teams to make data-driven decisions with confidence, aligning their budget allocation strategies with corporate financial objectives.

## 2.2) Expected Outcome
By integrating predictive analytics with cost-aware optimisation, the proposed approach ensures that:

1. Personalisation is tailored to customer needs while staying cost-effective
2. Marketing spend is optimised to maximise engagement and ROI
3. Business constraints (budget, regulations, customer fatigue) are respected in campaign execution.
4. This model provides a scalable, data-driven solution for banks looking to enhance marketing efficiency while maintaining high response rates.
