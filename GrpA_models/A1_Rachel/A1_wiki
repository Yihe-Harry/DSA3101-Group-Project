**Customer Segmentation Based on Banking Behavior and Preferences**
Objective:
To effectively segment customers using transactional data and customer attributes, helping banks personalize services, target marketing efforts, and improve customer retention.

Approach:
Data Collection and Preparation:
We used a dataset containing key customer information such as income, account balance, loyalty score, transaction history, and channel engagement.
Feature Engineering:
We engineered behavioral features like net transaction, frequency of transactions, and identified inactive customers. Missing values were treated meaningfully (e.g., missing last transaction date indicated inactivity).
Standardization and Clustering:
Numerical features were standardized, and K-Means clustering was applied. The Elbow Method and Silhouette Scores suggested that K=4 and K=5 were suitable values. We proceeded to analyze both.

Segmentation Outcome (K=5):
Based on the K=5 clustering model, we identified five distinct customer segments:

Cluster	 Customer Type	                  Key Traits
0	       High-Value                       Power Users	Low-mid income, lower balances, frequent transactions, high loyalty
1	       Budget-Conscious Occasionals	    Low-mid income, good balances, low engagement, cautious savers
2	       Value-Driven Frequent Users	    High income, low balances, frequent but low-value activity, low loyalty
3	       Affluent Inactives	              High income, high balances, low transactions, minimal engagement
4	       Cautious Regulars	              High income, good balances, moderate usage, strong loyalty


Conclusion:
By combining transactional patterns (e.g., frequency and net value of transactions) with demographics and product engagement, we can cluster customers into behaviorally meaningful groups. This enables:

Tailored financial product offerings
Targeted marketing (e.g., upsell to High-Value Power Users)
Re-engagement strategies for inactive but affluent customers
Loyalty rewards for cautious yet consistent users
This segmentation approach supports data-driven decision-making and more personalized banking experiences.
