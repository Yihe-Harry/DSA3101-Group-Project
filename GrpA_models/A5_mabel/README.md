# Segmentation updates (Real-Time Customer Segmentation)

## Overview
By dynamically updating customer segments based on their latest transactions and behaviors, banks can improve engagement and optimise marketing effectiveness.

## Implementation
### Segmentation Model (Subgroup A - Question 1)
Using the dataset and segmentation model form A1, we have used a selected customer's profile to simulate how real-time updates can affect their segmentation outcome.

### Real-Time Segmentation (Subgroup A - Question 5)
1. **Simulating Updates**: A fixed customer’s attributes (income, loyalty score, balance, transactions) are modified to reflect real-world changes.
2. **Re-Standardisation**: The dataset is reprocessed to account for these changes.
3. **Re-Clustering**: The K-Means algorithm is rerun to observe segment shifts.
4. **Cluster Evolution Analysis**: The changes in the customer’s cluster assignment are visualised to demonstrate the impact of real-time updates.

## Business Impact
- **Personalised Marketing**: Customers are categorised based on current behaviour, reducing outdated targeting.
- **Dynamic Strategy Adjustments**: The bank can proactively tailor engagement strategies based on recent customer activity.
- **Higher ROI**: Efficient marketing allocation by focusing on customers who are most likely to engage based on their updated segmentation.

By continuously refining segmentation with real-time data, banks can optimise customer interactions and ensure marketing campaigns remain impactful and relevant.
